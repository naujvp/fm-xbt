\subsection{\lang{Purpose}{Prop\'osito}}

The purpose of this document is to detail the Satellite Communications 
Equipment aliveness, functional and performance test procedures for the X-Band Modulator, for de FM units.
X-band filter is present in the test setup but is fully characterized in AD.0\ref{ad:xbandfilter}. 
The objective of test procedure is to ensure repeatability of results. 

\subsection{\lang{Scope}{Alcance}}

This document should be considered as the main reference for aliveness, 
functional and performance test procedure of X-Band Modulator FM units. 
%Where the elementary functional test is understood to be those 
%minimum tests that must be carried out to verify the operation of Communication SS EM units.
